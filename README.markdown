SESpringBoard
====================

Introduction
---------------------

SESpringBoard is an easy to use launcher view for you to use in your iPhone apps. Just add all the files under SESpringBoard into your project and you are good to go!

[AKB]: This version has some significant differences to the original.

  - It uses a plist for the menuitems at start up
  - It allows user to add new items (at the moment hard coded)
  - It is now universal - runs on iPad and iPhone/iPod Touch
  - It now supports auto-rotating

Usage
---------------------

```objective-c

vc1 = [[ChildViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"ChildViewController" bundle:nil];
vc2 = [[ChildViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"ChildViewController" bundle:nil];
// create or reference more view controllers here
// also be sure to extend your view controllers from SEViewController
    
// create an array of SEMenuItem objects
NSMutableArray *items = [NSMutableArray array];
[items addObject:[SEMenuItem initWithTitle:@"facebook" imageName:@"facebook.png" viewController:vc1 removable:YES]];
[items addObject:[SEMenuItem initWithTitle:@"twitter" imageName:@"twitter.png" viewController:vc2 removable:NO]];
[items addObject:[SEMenuItem initWithTitle:@"youtube" imageName:@"youtube.png" viewController:vc1 removable:YES]];
[items addObject:[SEMenuItem initWithTitle:@"linkedin" imageName:@"linkedin.png" viewController:vc2 removable:NO]];
    
// pass the array to a newly created SESpringBoard and add it to your view
SESpringBoard *board = [SESpringBoard initWithTitle:@"Welcome" items:items launcherImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"navbtn_home.png"]];
[self.view addSubview:board];

```
